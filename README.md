# Masters-thesis-NDHU

Main repository for my Master's thesis, including code and drafts for paper.

Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/read/kfgtqrrjvggd#6d6fa1

Topic: UAV Enabled Wireless Power Transfer 3D Path Planning for Survivability in Wireless Sensor Network Application

Advising Professor: Wei-Che Chien

Note: Will upload the paper source files, once it is finished, since there is no benefit in storing it separately in GitHub as well. The code part is still a work in progress and should be only used with specific input data in mind. To get terrain data use methods as such:
1) Using random generation to generate terrain, this does not have wind resistance implemented;
2) Using "Windninja" terrain data feature (it downloads TIF format terrain). Move TIF file generated by "Windninja" to windninja/tif directory and run "convert_wn_tif.sh" to get usable XYZ file for terrain;
3) !!!RECOMMENDED METHOD!!! Use NASADEM data base for better precision Digital Elevation Model (https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTSDEM.032021.4326.2). This provides a TAR.GZ file, upload it to windninja/NASADEM and run "convert_NASADEM_tif.sh", this will provide a usable TIF file for "Windninja" wind simulations and a usable XYZ for terrain.

Upcoming improvements: WPT power conusmption integration, X-Means clustering ajustment to WPT maximum angle of reach, GA and ACO-2OPT implementation, simulation and results automation with comparison in mind

This work is in progress and the paper is not intended for public use just yet. However software is intented to be open-source, feel free to use it :)
