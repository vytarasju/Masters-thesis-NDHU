The static power consumtion formula that I apply (propulsion power consumtion) gives me watts. 

A watt is Joules/second. This means that watt is essentially a rate (or a speed) at which energy is consumed.

To understand how much energy it needs is simple, take Power (watts) and multiply by seconds of operation and you get Joules needed to operate.

How to understand how much battery that power would use?

There are multiple ways, but how I will do it.

Firstly, lets convert watts to watthours. Watthour is how much time 1 watt could continously run for. For example 1Wh = 1 watt running for 1 hour, 5Wh = 1W * 5hours = 1 watt running for 5 hours.

So let's say my power consumtion is 1095 watts when running at 10 meters/second speed (real example). My route takes 27 seconds to complete. Let's convert 27 seconds to hours, which is 0.0075 hours. 
So my Wh would be 1095W * 0.0075 hours = 8.21 Wh.

How to convert it to battery consumtion?
Battery capacity is measured in miliamp hours usually (mAh). For example AGRAS T10 has 9500 mAh battery.

convert watts and time of operation to mAh. That would be how much capacity is needed to complete that operation. To do so there is a formula: Energy used from battery (watt-hours) = voltage provided by battery (volts) * battery capacity (amp-hours): E = V * Q

Let's take T10 AGRAS again, battery voltage is 52.22V.

Converting this formula to calculate capacity we get: Q = E / V
So battery capacity needed for 1095W 27s operation (which is 8.21Wh) and battery with 52.22V is equal to 0.1572 Ah

Since most battery capacity is written as mili amp hour we convert and get 157.2 mAh which is about 1.6% of battery capacity

How to calculate total duration of battery with the constant consumtion?

we need to get amps from power (watts) and voltage (V). Since P = V * I, then we can get I = P / V.
In our case I = 1095W / 52.22V = 20.9689A = 21A = 21000mA

then, if we have battery with 9500 mAh and we have used 21000 mA, we can get battery life = capacity / load current = 9500mAh / 21000mA = 0.45hour

60min * 0.45 = 27 minutes

If we take proportions (getting consumtion per 1 minute and getting what consumtion is for 100% of battery) we will get the same results.
