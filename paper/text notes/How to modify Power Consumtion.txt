I already have power calcualtions for propulsion with drag force. However this is a static equation. In that equation
wind speed and direction is not considered, only speed of the object is. That equation calculates how much force
does the drone need to push through air particles, however - especially in a mountainous environment - air never stays still.

I need to introduce dynamic equation on top of this calculation to get realistic power consumtion/speeds.

The current problem: the faster object goes - the more it is impacted by wind. More wind impact, more power needed
to push against it in order to achieve the same speed as if there would be no wind at all.

Real life situation:
if a drone is going 70 km/h in no wind environment and it is using 300mAh of battery,
then in a windy environment if the drone is going to use 300mAh for the same path, it will go slower and end up not reaching 
the same distance as it did in no wind environment.

With quadcopter UAVs, the faster a drone goes, the less power it needs to use (because of how air intake works on a tilted angle).
So theoretically, UAV uses more power when going against winds, because winds slow it down and slower speed equals to more power consumtion,
and also, if the same destination from A to B is needed to be achieved, it will take longer to do so (hence if a path takes 30 seconds and
uses 300mAh, now it will take, for example 35 seconds, hence another reason for higher usage).
