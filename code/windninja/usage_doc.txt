This is a quick instruction how to use these scripts and aquire terrain and wind results.

Highly recommend simply using NASADEM for terrain:

 1) Download terrain data from: https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTSDEM.032021.4326.2
 2) You will receive .tar.gz file, upload it to NASADEM folder at /code/windninja directory
 3) Run "bash convert_NASADEM_tif.sh filename.tar.gz" replacing filename with the the actual name of the
  file aquired from NASADEM, which if you have not changed, will by default be "output_NASADEM.tar.gz"
 4) This script will create an XYZ file, located at /converted, use this for terrain data by using
  terrain = readTerrainXYZ(filename) and terrain = convertXYZtoMeters(filename) to convert the scale to meters
 5) Take .tif file, which is located at /tif directory, it was created after bash script
 6) Use that .tif with WindNinja to simulate wind results
 7) Get wind results in .asc format, you only need vel.asc and ang.asc, which is velocity and angle of wind
 8) Move vel.asc and ang.asc to /wind directory and run "bash convert_wind_afterNASADEM filename", this time
  usage is sligtly different - when vel.asc and ang.asc are created, they will be named in a specific way.
  If file name = output_NASADEM.tif, wind angle is 60 degrees and strength is 3 kts, at 30m terrain resolution 
  then file names are going to be
   a) output_NASADEM_60_3_30m_vel.asc
   b) output_NASADEM_60_3_30m_ang.asc
  Hence in this case the script should be ran with this command:
  "bash convert_wind_afterNASADEM output_NASADEM_60_3_30m"
  The script will automatically detect the terrain for this file and the individual vel and ang files
 9) Finally, to read these files use:
  wind = readWindASCWindninja(terrain, wind_velocity_name, wind_angle_name)

Using WindNinja terrain downlaod file, the process is easier, since it automatically downloads the correct tif file 
and uses that for wind generation, so just run "bash convert_wn_tif.sh filename.tif", which will create XYZ terrain 
file, drop wind files at /wind directory and use the same read functions.
